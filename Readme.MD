# CCL Mentoring Program API - Mentees Grades
This a work in progress small API developed with Python using
python-anywhere as our deployment site. Since the current plan is free
I decided to build a local version using another external resource called
https://aiven.io to deploy a demo MySQL Db so that I can use it to add some mock data
while I complete the Python-Anywhere version using flask-login as well.
